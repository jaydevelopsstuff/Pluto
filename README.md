### This project is currently inactive
Don't expect much work to be done on this, I started mainly just for fun to see if I could reverse engineer Terraria's protocol but I've moved on to other things now and I don't have the time for a project like this. Feel free to open a PR if you want to add something though.

# Pluto Rewrite
This is a rewrite of the original Pluto project. I feel that Pluto has become too bloated, and I hit a major roadblock
in its development and I think rewriting it would be more beneficial than spending a ton of time on the original project.

# Contributing
Contributions to the rewrite are highly appreciated! If you would like to help out with the project don't hesitate to 
open a PR. If you have any questions please visit the discord.
